Thanks Chris and Jes.

At least on Google's side, a permissive license generally makes things easier
for people -- even though in practice we'll be upstreaming all changes anyway.
Since fsverity-utils is only a small project and is unlikely to be customized
much by people (as it's closely tied to the upstream kernel support), for now
I'd rather not create problems for users or cause duplication of effort.

If it were a larger project, or something people would be more likely to
customize, the case for LGPL would be stronger IMO.

There are also OpenSSL linking exceptions out there even for the LGPL (!), so
I'm not sure everyone agrees that one isn't needed...  I'd like to avoid wasting
time on any such issues and just write code :-)

Note that we can always choose to move to LGPL later, but LGPL => MIT won't be
possible (since in line with kernel community norms, for fsverity-utils we're
only requiring the DCO, not a CLA).  I think we shouldn't go down a one-way
street too early.

I've send out a patch to change the license.  Can you two explicitly give
Acked-by on the patch itself?  Thanks!
