Eric,

I certainly don't expect your crypto stuff to plug in without any
modification to what we currently have. I'm just observing that the
existing plumbing is designed to have pluggable functions that let
filesystems attach additional information to bios on writes and process
additional attached information on reads. And the block layer already
handles slicing and dicing these attachments as the I/O traverses the
stack.

There's also other stuff that probably won't be directly applicable or
interesting for your use case. It just seems like identifying actual
commonalities and differences would be worthwhile.

Note that substantial changes to the integrity code would inevitably
lead to a lot of pain and suffering for me. So from that perspective I
am very happy if you leave it alone. From an architectural viewpoint,
however, it seems that there are more similarities than differences
between crypto and integrity. And we should avoid duplication where
possible. That's all.

Absolutely. That's why it's a union. Putting your stuff there is a
prerequisite as far as I'm concerned. No need to grow the bio when the
two features are unlikely to coexist. We can revisit that later should
the need arise.
