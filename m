Well, this is mostly because we're trying to be a good kernel citizen and
minimize the overhead when our feature isn't enabled or isn't being used.

Eventually we might remove CONFIG_FS_ENCRYPTION_INLINE_CRYPT and make
CONFIG_FS_ENCRYPTION always offer inline crypto support, which would simplify
things.  But for now we'd like to keep the separate option.

Also, previously people have complained about hardcoded S_ISREG() to decide
whether a file needs contents encryption, and said they prefer a helper function
fscrypt_needs_contents_encryption().  (Which is what we have now.)

So we can't make everyone happy...

->i_crypt_info is set when the file is opened, so it's guaranteed to be set for
any I/O.  So the case you're concerned about just doesn't happen.

If we're talking about handling a hypothetical bug where it does nevertheless
happen, there are three options:

(a) Crash (current behavior)
(b) Silently leave the file unencrypted, i.e. silently introduce a critical
    security vulnerability.
(c) Return an error, which would add a lot of code complexity because we'd have
    start returning an error from places like fscrypt_set_bio_crypt_ctx() that
    currently can't fail.  This would be dead code that's not tested.

I very much prefer (a), since it's the simplest option, and it also makes the
bug most likely to be reported and fixed, without leaving the possibility for
data to silently be left unencrypted.  Crashing isn't good (obviously), but the
other options are worse.

Sure, this is harmless currently, but we can move the assignment to 'ci'.

I think you're missing the point here.  Currently, the granularity of encryption
(a.k.a. "data unit size") is always filesystem blocks, so that's the minimum we
can directly read or write to an encrypted file.  This has nothing to do with
the IV wraparound case also being discussed.

For example, changing a single bit in the plaintext of a filesystem block may
result in the entire block's ciphertext changing.  (The exact behavior depends
on the cryptographic algorithm that is used.)

That's why this patchset makes ext4 only allow direct I/O on encrypted files if
the I/O is fully filesystem-block-aligned.  Note that this might be a more
strict alignment requirement than the bdev_logical_block_size().

As long as the iomap code only issues filesystem-block-aligned bios, *given
fully filesystem-block-aligned inputs*, we're fine.  That appears to be the case
currently.  I was just pointing out that some changes might be needed to
maintain this property in the blocksize > PAGE_SIZE case (which again, for
encrypted files is totally unsupported at the moment anyway).

(It's possible that in the future we'll support other encryption data unit
sizes, perhaps powers of 2 from 512 to filesystem block size.  But for now the
filesystem block size has been good enough for everyone, and there would be a
significant performance hit when using a smaller size, so there hasn't been a
need to add the extra layer of complexity.)
